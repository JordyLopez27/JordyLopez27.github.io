   <h2>Structure of Recitations (Mondays)</h2>

    <li>Necessary equipment: Some type of display (such as a small whiteboard or tablet) to present solutions. Also markers and eraser. Ah, also bring pens/pencils to take weekly quizzes.
      </li>
    <li>We will form groups, and you will be lead by a Peer Mentor. In the groups you will present solutions to problems given to you the previous week (more on this later).</li>
    <li>There will be an individual quiz at the end of the session. It will usually consist of 3-4 questions based on the material of the previous week. </li>
    <li>Absent? Need makeup? report to me your absence no later that the following Monday at 11:59 PM</li>
    
    <h2>Structure of Laboratories (Wednesdays)</h2>
    <li>Necessary equipment: Laptops, fully charged! We do not always have outlets available.</li>
    <li>We will also form groups of 3-4 students each. If you already have buddies to work with, please one of you email me, CC'ing everyone, and stating that you want to work together. Deadline: Wednesday, Aug. 31st at 5 PM.</li>
    <li>Download Jupyter notebooks (interface for python) in <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/"> Anaconda</a>. Instructions available <a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~aforan/Math150Python/M150Overview.pdf"> here</a>.</li>
    <li>Submit Python labs to Gradescope. You will need to set up a free account USING YOUR @TAMU.EDU EMAIL. Otherwise you may not have access to the course there.</li>
   <li>Python assignment webpage is found in Canvas. You can also find it <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gGO8WdpbdFW1ETlJ7t1u8OfebnUvVfH0xa-QhNyRZ3M/edit?usp=sharing"> here</a>. See mark below.</li>

    <li> More resources to learn Python are available in the <a href="https://mlc.tamu.edu/Virtual-Math-Learning-Center/Supplemental-Material/Python-mini-course"> Mathematics Learning Center</a>. I highly suggest that you get a cup of coffee/tea  and swim through these materials during the first two weeks of the semester.</li>
    
   <h2>Exam Weeks</h2>
   <li>No quiz/lab that week. Instead, we will review for such exam.</li>
   <li>We still have group presentations those weeks!</li>
